Title: Tomato AI or TAI

Descrpiton: TAI is an image classifier that take pictures of tomatoes and determines if they are ripe. This project makes use of Python Imaging Library and Numpy.

While the purpose of this project was to identify tomatoes, it can be applied much more. The project contains a machine learning framework that could be used for many projects. Changing a few elements and arguments could tailor the program to your needs. For instance, this project can be used to classify irises from the famous Iris Dataset!
